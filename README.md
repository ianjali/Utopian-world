# Utopian-world
 I am analyzing datasets of two different worlds and discovering which is more idealistic.

 # Dataset 
 The dataset consists of following variables : 

* age00: the age at the time of creation. This is only the population from age 30-60.  
* education: years of education they have had. Education assumed to have stopped. A static data column.  
* marital: 0-never married, 1-married, 2-divorced, 3-widowed  
* gender: 0-female, 1-male (for simplicity)  
* ethnic: 0, 1, 2 (just made up)  
* income00: annual income at the time of creation   
* industry: (ordered with increasing average annual salary, according to govt data.)

    0. leisure n hospitality  
    1. retail   
    2. Education   
    3. Health   
    4. construction   
    5. manufacturing   
    6. professional n business   
    7. finance   
 
Utopia is a subjective term and hence I have first defined the utopia as a place where following conditions are satisfied 
1. Equal pay scale irrespective of the industry(Clearly not satisfied for both the worlds) 
2. Equal pay for all irrespective of
 i) Gender 
 ii) Ethnicity
3. Equal Job Opportunities 
 i) Equal distribution of Gender 
 ii) Ethnicity in various Job Sector 
4. Equal education opportunities for both men and women.
